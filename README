How to compile: As we are using IntelliJ forms to build this project this issue is more complex than it seems.
We attempted unsuccessfully to provide an ant build file so it could be compiled on the command line as requested.
As of now though the only way to compile this project is to install IntelliJ and import the project.  Included is
also a .jar that is the working program.
